                               OpenVDB
========================================================================

The OpenVDB library comprises a hierarchical data structure and a suite 
of tools for the efficient manipulation of sparse, possibly time-varying, 
volumetric data discretized on a three-dimensional grid. 

For instructions on library installation and dependencies see INSTALL

For documentation of the library and code examples see doc/html/index.html

Technical details on the data structure will be described in the paper
"VDB: High-resolution sparse volumes volumes with dynamic topology",
to be published in ACM Transactions on Graphics
